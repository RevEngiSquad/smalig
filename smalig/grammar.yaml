- opcode: "01"
  name: "move"
  format: "B|A|op"
  format_id: "12x"
  syntax: "move vA, vB"
  args_info: "A: destination register (4 bits), B: source register (4 bits)"
  short_desc: "Move the contents of one non-object register to another."
  long_desc: "Moves the content of vB into vA. Both registers must be in the first 256 register range & 4 bits."
  note: ""
  example: "0110 - move v0, v1"
  example_desc: "Moves the content of v1 into v0."

- opcode: "28"
  name: "goto"
  format: "AA|op"
  format_id: "10t"
  syntax: "goto target"
  args_info: "target: signed branch offset (8 bits)"
  short_desc: "Unconditionally jump to the indicated instruction."
  long_desc: "Unconditionally jump to the indicated short (8 bits) instruction offset."
  note: "The branch offset must not be 0. (A spin loop may be legally constructed either with goto/32 or by including a nop as a target before the branch.)"
  example: "28E9 - goto 0x000150EA"
  example_desc: "Jumps to the instruction at address 0x000150EA."
